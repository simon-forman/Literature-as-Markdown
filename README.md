# Literature as Markdown

A collection of classic literature presented in markdown format. All titles from the public domain.

This is my own spin on [mlschmitt](https://github.com/mlschmitt)’s amazing collection. My attempt is to make this library compatible with [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/).

To-Do:
- [ ] Insert yaml metadata.
- [ ] Create bibliography for the authors.
- [ ] Expand the collection.

Other excellent resources for classic books:
* [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/)
* [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/)
